# Travelling Application

>This project aims to use multiple APIs [Geonames API](http://www.geonames.org/export/web-services.html), [Weatherbit API](https://www.weatherbit.io/api/weather-current), and [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) in order to gather enough information about a user's destination and show them.


## The Goal of This Project
This project is the capstone, it contains all previous skills learned through the nanodegree such as:
- CSS, Website Layout, Website components
- JS & The DOM
- Web APIs and Asynchronous
- Build Tools and Single Page Web Apps

## Suggestions to stand out
I have added the following suggestions:
- "Incorporate icons into forecast."
- "Pull in an image for the country from Pixabay API when the entered location brings up no results (good for obscure localities)."

## Contribution
This project was created solely by Abdulrahman Alosaimi for educational purposes.
